## Recent Changes

### Recurring Transaction Tracking (2025-12-15)

**Smart Budget Trending with Recurring Expenses**

Traditional budget progress bars assume expenses are evenly distributed throughout the month. However, large recurring expenses like rent and utilities often hit at the beginning of the month, making it appear you're "over budget" when you're actually on track. This feature solves that problem.

**How It Works:**

When you mark a transaction as recurring (rent, mortgage, utilities, subscriptions), the budget system treats it differently:

- **Recurring expenses** are counted as "expected" immediately from day 1 of the month
- **Variable expenses** continue to scale evenly through the month
- The blue "expected spending" line on progress bars adjusts to show: `expected = recurring expenses + (variable expenses × % through month)`

**Example:**
Let's say you have a $1,500 monthly budget:
- $1,000 rent (marked as recurring, paid on day 1)
- $500 in groceries and other variable expenses

Without recurring tracking:
- Day 1: You've spent $1,000 of $50 expected (1,900% over budget! 😱)
- Day 15: You've spent $1,200 of $750 expected (160% over budget 😰)

With recurring tracking:
- Day 1: You've spent $1,000 of $1,016 expected (98% - on track! ✅)
- Day 15: You've spent $1,200 of $1,250 expected (96% - on track! ✅)

**Features:**
- Mark any transaction as recurring with the Repeat icon button
- Recurring transactions show a badge in the transactions table
- Progress bars automatically calculate smarter expected spending
- Tooltips show breakdown: "Expected: $1,250 ($1,000 recurring + $250 variable)"
- Works seamlessly with income offsets within categories

**Technical Implementation:**
- Added `recurring` boolean column to transactions table
- Separate tracking of `recurringExpenses` vs `variableExpenses` per category
- Smart expected spending formula in budget progress calculations
- API endpoint: `PUT /api/transactions/[id]/recurring`

**Files Modified:**
- `scripts/017_add_recurring_to_transactions.sql` - Database migration
- `components/transactions-table.tsx` - UI toggle and display
- `app/api/transactions/[id]/recurring/route.ts` - API endpoint
- `app/(app)/budgets/page.tsx` - Data fetching and calculation
- `components/budget-list.tsx` - Progress bar logic
- `components/budget-overview.tsx` - Interface updates

**Migration Required:**
Run `scripts/017_add_recurring_to_transactions.sql` in Supabase to add the recurring column.

## Native Mobile App Development (Capacitor)

### Building the Native App

The app uses Capacitor to create native iOS and Android applications with full access to native device features.

#### Prerequisites

**For iOS Development:**
- macOS with Xcode 14+ installed
- iOS Simulator or physical iOS device
- Apple Developer account (for device testing/deployment)

**For Android Development:**
- Android Studio installed
- Android SDK and emulator configured
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+

#### Build Process

1. **Build the Next.js app:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Sync web assets to native platforms:**
   ```bash
   npm run cap:sync
   ```

3. **Open native IDE:**
   ```bash
   # For iOS
   npm run cap:open:ios

   # For Android
   npm run cap:open:android
   ```

4. **Build and run from IDE:**
   - **iOS**: Click the Play button in Xcode to run on simulator or device
   - **Android**: Click Run in Android Studio to launch on emulator or device

#### Quick Development Workflow

Use the convenience scripts for faster iteration:

```bash
# Build and open iOS project
npm run dev:ios

# Build and open Android project
npm run dev:android
```

### Mobile-Specific Features

#### Capacitor Storage API
- Replace `localStorage` calls with the storage utilities from `lib/capacitor.ts`
- Automatically uses Capacitor Preferences on native, falls back to localStorage on web
- JSON caching utilities for complex data structures

```typescript
import { storage, cache } from '@/lib/capacitor'

// Simple storage
await storage.set('key', 'value')
const value = await storage.get('key')

// JSON caching
await cache.setJSON('user', { name: 'John', age: 30 })
const user = await cache.getJSON('user')
```

#### Haptic Feedback
- All buttons automatically trigger haptic feedback
- Use the `useHaptics` hook for custom interactions

```typescript
import { useHaptics } from '@/hooks/use-haptics'

const haptics = useHaptics()

// Light tap
haptics.light()

// Success notification
haptics.success()

// Error notification
haptics.error()
```

#### Keyboard Handling
- Use the `useKeyboard` hook for smart keyboard management
- Automatically scrolls inputs into view when keyboard appears

```typescript
import { useKeyboard } from '@/hooks/use-keyboard'

const { isKeyboardVisible, hideKeyboard } = useKeyboard({
  autoScroll: true,
  scrollOffset: 20,
  onKeyboardShow: () => console.log('Keyboard opened'),
  onKeyboardHide: () => console.log('Keyboard closed')
})
```

#### Safe Area Support
- Use CSS utility classes for safe area padding:
  - `.safe-top` - Add padding for status bar/notch
  - `.safe-bottom` - Add padding for home indicator
  - `.safe-area` - Add padding on all sides
  - `.h-screen-safe` - Full height minus safe areas

```tsx
<div className="safe-top">
  Content that respects iOS notch
</div>
```

#### Platform Detection
```typescript
import { isNativePlatform, isIOS, isAndroid, isWeb } from '@/lib/capacitor'

if (isNativePlatform()) {
  // Native-specific code
}

if (isIOS()) {
  // iOS-specific code
}
```

### Performance Optimizations

#### Client-Side Rendering
- Heavy pages (dashboard, transactions) use client-side data fetching
- Data is cached in Capacitor Storage for instant loads
- Fresh data is fetched in background while showing cached data

#### Offline Support
- Service worker caches static assets
- Capacitor Storage caches dynamic data
- App works offline with last loaded data

#### Mobile-Specific Optimizations
- Disabled tap highlight for cleaner UI
- Touch action optimizations for smooth scrolling
- 44px minimum tap targets for accessibility
- Responsive breakpoint at 768px (md:)

### Troubleshooting

**Bundle Identifier Issues (iOS):**
If you see an error like "The app identifier 'com.budgetapp.app' cannot be registered":
1. Open `capacitor.config.ts`
2. Change the `appId` to a unique identifier:
   ```typescript
   appId: 'com.yourname.budgetapp', // Use your own unique ID
   ```
3. Run `npm run cap:sync` to update the native projects
4. Open Xcode and update the Bundle Identifier in the project settings

**iOS Build Issues:**
- Ensure Xcode is updated to latest version
- Run `pod install` in `ios/App` directory if pods are out of date
- Clean build folder: Product → Clean Build Folder
- Change Bundle Identifier to a unique string in Xcode project settings
- Ensure you're signed in with an Apple Developer account in Xcode

**Android Build Issues:**
- Check SDK is installed via Android Studio SDK Manager
- Ensure JAVA_HOME is set correctly
- Sync Gradle files in Android Studio
- Change `applicationId` in `android/app/build.gradle` if needed

**Data not persisting:**
- Check Capacitor Storage permissions in native settings
- Verify `await` is used with all storage operations
- Check browser console for errors on web platform
