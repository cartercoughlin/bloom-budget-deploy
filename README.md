   ```bash
   vercel deploy
   ```

3. **Install on Mobile**
   - **iOS**: Safari → Share → Add to Home Screen
   - **Android**: Chrome → Menu → Install App
   - **Desktop**: Chrome → Address bar → Install icon

## Native Mobile App Development (Capacitor)

### Building the Native App

The app uses Capacitor to create native iOS and Android applications with full access to native device features.

#### Prerequisites

**For iOS Development:**
- macOS with Xcode 14+ installed
- iOS Simulator or physical iOS device
- Apple Developer account (for device testing/deployment)

**For Android Development:**
- Android Studio installed
- Android SDK and emulator configured
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+

#### Build Process

1. **Build the Next.js app:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Sync web assets to native platforms:**
   ```bash
   npm run cap:sync
   ```

3. **Open native IDE:**
   ```bash
   # For iOS
   npm run cap:open:ios

   # For Android
   npm run cap:open:android
   ```

4. **Build and run from IDE:**
   - **iOS**: Click the Play button in Xcode to run on simulator or device
   - **Android**: Click Run in Android Studio to launch on emulator or device

#### Quick Development Workflow

Use the convenience scripts for faster iteration:

```bash
# Build and open iOS project
npm run dev:ios

# Build and open Android project
npm run dev:android
```

### Mobile-Specific Features

#### Capacitor Storage API
- Replace `localStorage` calls with the storage utilities from `lib/capacitor.ts`
- Automatically uses Capacitor Preferences on native, falls back to localStorage on web
- JSON caching utilities for complex data structures

```typescript
import { storage, cache } from '@/lib/capacitor'

// Simple storage
await storage.set('key', 'value')
const value = await storage.get('key')

// JSON caching
await cache.setJSON('user', { name: 'John', age: 30 })
const user = await cache.getJSON('user')
```

#### Haptic Feedback
- All buttons automatically trigger haptic feedback
- Use the `useHaptics` hook for custom interactions

```typescript
import { useHaptics } from '@/hooks/use-haptics'

const haptics = useHaptics()

// Light tap
haptics.light()

// Success notification
haptics.success()

// Error notification
haptics.error()
```

#### Keyboard Handling
- Use the `useKeyboard` hook for smart keyboard management
- Automatically scrolls inputs into view when keyboard appears

```typescript
import { useKeyboard } from '@/hooks/use-keyboard'

const { isKeyboardVisible, hideKeyboard } = useKeyboard({
  autoScroll: true,
  scrollOffset: 20,
  onKeyboardShow: () => console.log('Keyboard opened'),
  onKeyboardHide: () => console.log('Keyboard closed')
})
```

#### Safe Area Support
- Use CSS utility classes for safe area padding:
  - `.safe-top` - Add padding for status bar/notch
  - `.safe-bottom` - Add padding for home indicator
  - `.safe-area` - Add padding on all sides
  - `.h-screen-safe` - Full height minus safe areas

```tsx
<div className="safe-top">
  Content that respects iOS notch
</div>
```

#### Platform Detection
```typescript
import { isNativePlatform, isIOS, isAndroid, isWeb } from '@/lib/capacitor'

if (isNativePlatform()) {
  // Native-specific code
}

if (isIOS()) {
  // iOS-specific code
}
```

### Performance Optimizations

#### Client-Side Rendering
- Heavy pages (dashboard, transactions) use client-side data fetching
- Data is cached in Capacitor Storage for instant loads
- Fresh data is fetched in background while showing cached data

#### Offline Support
- Service worker caches static assets
- Capacitor Storage caches dynamic data
- App works offline with last loaded data

#### Mobile-Specific Optimizations
- Disabled tap highlight for cleaner UI
- Touch action optimizations for smooth scrolling
- 44px minimum tap targets for accessibility
- Responsive breakpoint at 768px (md:)

### Troubleshooting

**Bundle Identifier Issues (iOS):**
If you see an error like "The app identifier 'com.budgetapp.app' cannot be registered":
1. Open `capacitor.config.ts`
2. Change the `appId` to a unique identifier:
   ```typescript
   appId: 'com.yourname.budgetapp', // Use your own unique ID
   ```
3. Run `npm run cap:sync` to update the native projects
4. Open Xcode and update the Bundle Identifier in the project settings

**iOS Build Issues:**
- Ensure Xcode is updated to latest version
- Run `pod install` in `ios/App` directory if pods are out of date
- Clean build folder: Product → Clean Build Folder
- Change Bundle Identifier to a unique string in Xcode project settings
- Ensure you're signed in with an Apple Developer account in Xcode

**Android Build Issues:**
- Check SDK is installed via Android Studio SDK Manager
- Ensure JAVA_HOME is set correctly
- Sync Gradle files in Android Studio
- Change `applicationId` in `android/app/build.gradle` if needed

**Data not persisting:**
- Check Capacitor Storage permissions in native settings
- Verify `await` is used with all storage operations
- Check browser console for errors on web platform
